Welcome to GodotOS! This handbook will show in detail all the things you can do in GodotOS.

Chapters:
	1. Handling windows
	2. Managing files
	3. Playing games

----- CHAPTER 1: HANDLING WINDOWS -----
To open a new window, you can either double click a file or open a game through the start menu in the bottom left of the screen.
Judging by the fact that you're reading this, you already figured out how to open files. Congratulations!

You can drag a window by holding left click on the top bar and moving your mouse. You cannot move windows outside of the screen.
You can resize a window by dragging the bottom right corner of the window. Hold shift while dragging to maintain the aspect ratio.
Every window spawned has a taskbar button that spawns next to the start menu (bottom left of the screen). Clicking that window's taskbar button will minimize or restore the window. You can also press the _ button in the top right of the window to minimize it.
Click the X button in the top right of a window to close it.

Notice the COLORS of each window. Every window type has a specific color theme:
	* Blue windows are text editors (like this one!)
	* Green windows are file managers
	* Yellow windows are images
	* Purple windows are games
