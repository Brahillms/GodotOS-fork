Welcome to GodotOS! This handbook will show in detail all the things you can do in GodotOS.

Chapters:
	1. Handling windows
	2. Managing files
	3. Playing games

----- CHAPTER 1: HANDLING WINDOWS -----
To open a new window, you can either double click a file or open a game through the start menu in the bottom left of the screen.
Judging by the fact that you're reading this, you already figured out how to open files. Congratulations!

You can drag a window by holding left click on the top bar and moving your mouse. You cannot move windows outside of the screen.
You can resize a window by dragging the bottom right corner of the window. Hold shift while dragging to maintain the aspect ratio.
In the top left of a window are three buttons: Minimize, Maximize, and Close.
Every window spawned has a taskbar button that spawns next to the start menu (bottom left of the screen). Clicking that window's taskbar button will minimize or restore the window.

Notice the COLORS of each window. Every window type has a specific color theme:
	* Blue windows are text editors (like this one!)
	* Green windows are file managers
	* Yellow windows are images
	* Purple windows are games

----- CHAPTER 2: MANAGING FILES -----
GodotOS uses real folders and files that are stored in your system.
Where they're stored depends on the operating system, but you can use "CTRL + SHIFT + F" to open your files outside of GodotOS (try it now!)
Note that people using GodotOS on the web can't access their files due to browser restrictions :(

You import your files into GodotOS by either dragging them over GodotOS or placing them in your own file manager. The changes will sync immediately.
To export your files, simply open the files in your file manager (CTRL + SHIFT + F) and copy them out. 

Only support files will be seen by GodotOS. These are currently:
	* Image files (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
	* Text files (TXT, MD)
